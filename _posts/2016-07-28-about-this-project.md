# About this Project

I decided to be more structured in keeping and organizing the reading, and consequently, the thinking about the reading, that I do on a daily basis. This blog will be the place that I track my reading and my thinking; it is a commonplace book of sorts.

For the next few months I intend to focus a lot on works related to international relations and diplomacy, leadership, higher education, science fiction, poetry, entrepreneurship and technology. Although this list is pretty expansive, I don't intend it to limit my selection of interesting materials. If works surface that stand outside of these broad topic areas, no problem. They are still fair game.

Thanks for reading. Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions, or want to suggest works that should be added to the list.
